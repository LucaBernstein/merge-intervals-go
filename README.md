# Merge Intervals

This package merges overlapping number intervals.

## Usage

```bash
go run . <input intervals>
```

Larger datasets of intervals to merge can be provided via file and env var:

```bash
INTERVALS_FILE=<filename> go run .
```

## Example

The input `[25,30] [2,19] [14,23] [4,8]` should yield the output `[2,23] [25,30]`.

```bash
# Input
go run . "[25,30] [2,19] [14,23] [4,8]"

# Output
[2,23] [25,30]
```

## Performance and Footprint

This package includes benchmark tests that show how different parts behave with different loads (input parsing, interval merge).

Sample output of `go test -bench=. -run=XXX -benchmem`:

In the current implementation, the calculations are executed in a single thread only.
Hence, for a larger amount of intervals provided, the runtime increases linearly.
The memory footprint also increases linearly for storing the intervals internally.

For example, during the `BenchmarkMergeDistinct1000000` benchmark run, a memory allocation of around `40 MB` during execution has been observed.
Likewise, during the `BenchmarkMergeDistinct10000000` benchmark run, the memory allocation observed has been around `400 MB`.

## Considerations and Assumptions

* Order of intervals passed can be unordered, but interval definition itself is ordered (`[ <start> , <end> ]` with `start <= end`)
* Interval start and end must be whole numbers (`â„¤`)
